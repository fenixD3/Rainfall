We see 2 functions: `v` and `main`. Let's disassemble the main()

# Main disass

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/main_disass.png)

Only `v` is called

# V disass

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/v_disass.png)

It uses `fgets`, `printf`, `fwrite` and `system`

Let's determine several strings

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/strings_v.png)

# Buffers size

Print the address from `<+26>` in `v`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/v_buf.png)

There is buffer with size `520`

There is an address in `<+18>` which represent the maximum bytes read by `fgets`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/real_buf.png)

It equals `512` and this is less than the size of the buffer in which we'll store the result meaning no buffer overflow is possible here.

# Global variables

Let's see on global and static variables in program

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/global_var.png)

All of these variables except m are generated by the compiler. It is located at address `0x0804988c`. 
This could be important since, in `v` there is a reference to this address

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/link_to_global_v.png)

Check what is stored in `m`, printing `0x40`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level3/Ressources/img/m_check.png)

It equals `64`
