We see 3 functions: `n`, `p` and `main`. Let's disassemble the main()

# Main disass

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/main_disass.png)

Only `n` is called

# N disass

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/n_disass.png)

It uses `fgets`, `p`, and `system`

# P disass

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/p_disass.png)

Only `printf` is used here

This is the same sa in previous level where we used format string to update some variable

# Strings used

Let's determine several strings in `n` (`<+66>`)

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/strings_n.png)

# Buffers size

Print the address from `<+26>` in `n`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/n_buf.png)

There is buffer with size `520`

There is an address in `<+18>` which represent the maximum bytes read by `fgets`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/real_buf.png)

It equals `512` and this is less than the size of the buffer in which we'll store the result meaning no buffer overflow is possible here.

# Global variables

Let's see on global and static variables in program

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/global_var.png)

All of these variables except m are generated by the compiler. It is located at address `0x08049810`. 
This could be important since, in `n` there is a reference to this address

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/link_to_global_n.png)

Check what is stored in `m`, printing `0x1025544`

![](/Users/a19523132/school/Rainfall/level4/Ressources/img/m_check.png)

It equals `16930116`
